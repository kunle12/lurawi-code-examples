# Lurawi Code Examples

This repository contains code examples developed under [Lurawi](https://github.com/kunle12/lurawi).

You can use them as a starting point to learn how to use Lurawi.

**NOTE** All LLM resources used in these examples assume locally running LLM(s) at the endpoint of `http://localhost:8080`. Modify the corresponding workflow to use LLM from external LLM providers.
